# AutoScore Introduction

AutoScore is a novel machine learning framework to automate the
development of interpretable clinical scoring models. AutoScore consists
of six modules: 1) variable ranking with machine learning, 2) variable
transformation, 3) score derivation, 4) model selection, 5) domain
knowledge-based score fine-tuning, and 6) performance evaluation. The
original AutoScore structure is elaborated in the article
(<http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21798>) and its flowchart is shown in the
following figure. AutoScore was originally designed for binary outcomes
and later extended to survival outcomes
(<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103959>) and ordinal outcomes
(<https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2202.08407>). AutoScore could
seamlessly generate risk scores using a parsimonious set of variables
for different types of clinical outcomes, which can be easily
implemented and validated in clinical practice. Moreover, it enables
users to build transparent and interpretable clinical scores quickly in
a straightforward manner. Please go to our bookdown page
(<https://nliulab.github.io/AutoScore/>) to find the full tutorial of
using AutoScore package

## Usage

The five pipeline functions constitute the 5-step AutoScore-based
process for generating point-based clinical scores for binary, survival
and ordinal outcomes.

This 5-step process gives users the flexibility of customization (e.g.,
determining the final list of variables according to the parsimony plot,
and fine-tuning the cutoffs in variable transformation). Please follow
the step-by-step instructions (in following Demos) to build your own
scores.

-   STEP(i): `AutoScore_rank()`or `AutoScore_rank_Survival()` or
    `AutoScore_rank_Ordinal()` - Rank variables with machine learning
    (AutoScore Module 1)
-   STEP(ii): `AutoScore_parsimony()` or
    `AutoScore_parsimony_Survival()` or
    `AutoScore_parsimony_Ordinal()` - Select the best model with
    parsimony plot (AutoScore Modules 2+3+4)
-   STEP(iii): `AutoScore_weighting()` or
    `AutoScore_weighting_Survival()` or
    `AutoScore_weighting_Ordinal()` - Generate the initial score with
    the final list of variables (Re-run AutoScore Modules 2+3)
-   STEP(iv): `AutoScore_fine_tuning()` or
    `AutoScore_fine_tuning_Survival()` or
    `AutoScore_fine_tuning_Ordinal()` - Fine-tune the score by revising
    `cut_vec` with domain knowledge (AutoScore Module 5)
-   STEP(v): `AutoScore_testing()` or `AutoScore_testing_Survival()` or
    `AutoScore_testing_Ordinal()` - Evaluate the final score with ROC
    analysis (AutoScore Module 6)

We also include several optional functions in the package, which could
help with data analysis and result reporting.
