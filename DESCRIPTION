Description:  AutoScore, a novel framework to automate the development of a clinical scoring model for predefined outcomes. AutoScore consists of six modules: variable ranking with machine learning, variable transformation, score derivation, model selection, domain knowledge-based score fine-tuning, and performance evaluation.The details are described in the manuscript<http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21798>. USers or clinicians could seamlessly generate generate parsimonious sparse-score risk models (i.e., risk scores), which can be easily implemented and validated in clinical practice.Also, it enables users to quickly build simple and transparent clinical scores. We hope to see its application in various medical case studies.
